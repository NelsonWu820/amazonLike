# Description
A full web application that simulates the Amazon purchasing experience with features such as buying items, seeing past user's comments and ratings, seeing past purchases, and rating products. Operating on the MERN stack, we've utilized React for the frontend, bolstered by Redux for streamlined state management. MongoDB serves as our reliable data repository, safeguarding user information until they opt for account deletion. On the backend, Node.js and Express seamlessly handle requests, ensuring smooth communication with Mongo for data retrieval.
